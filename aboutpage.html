    <p><i>Before jumping into the tech industry I worked as an arborist, trimming and cutting down trees as for 28
            years, and I greatly enjoyed my career. Climbing trees for a living - what's not to love? Unfortunately, a
            neck injury I incurred in late 2022 sidelined me, and that injury would eventually force me to find a new
            career. Honestly, with nearly 3 decades of very physically demanding work already on my body, I'm not sure
            how much longer my body would have tolerated working in that field anyway.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Although I've never worked in the tech field, I am a pretty avid player of video games, initially on consoles
            (Intellivision was my first!) but as I got older, on PC. MMOs, RPGs, FPS, Third-person shooters, puzzle
            games - I've played a lot of games across a lot of genres. Interstingly enough, though, ever since trying my
            hand at coding, with the help of some free online resources, my attention has been diverted away from my
            former hobby and I've scarcely touched any of the games in my library. It would seem that coding, somehow,
            "scratches the same itch" that videogames once did.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>With Fullstack Academy's help, I hope to capitalize on my natural enthusiasm for coding, and turn it into a
            prosperous, and (hopefully) injury-free new career.</i></p>
